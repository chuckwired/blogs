	People have many different ideas about UX (and UI), what someone in this position should be doing and how best to accomplish their tasks. One abstracted notion I've learnt recently is hitting that 'sweet spot' between the business wants and the user's needs. It's a process that already occurs to some extent shared between developers, stakeholders and project managers but is perhaps the #1 goal of any UX fanatic. In this blog we'll explore this idea, present a simple case study and finish with a few tools anyone can use in their day-to-day during modern Software Development to keep the sweetness flowing.

<h2>Differing Goals</h2>
<p> 
	Before we can hit the sweet spot we need to understand both sides; there's the business wants and the user needs. Business wants are generally driven from a high level with the aim to increase value for their business. Not neccesarily monetary but can involve efficiency, enriching their product or growth of the customer base. A business doesn't need these, but they want these. From both a developer and project manager perspective this will be discovered through inceptions and the day-to-day development of a project as it grows. Requirements may change, but overall the main focus of a successful project should remain the same.

	User needs are called so because in order to satisfy the wants of a business, we have to address what the user will need in order to happily succeed. For example, a business want may be for a user to be able to process 50 orders per hour. To do that we need to understand the user's workflow, common pitfalls and restrictions so that we can best help design a system that facilitates that goal. Humans are capable of complex thought, and unfortunately irrational patterns, but we cannot force them to fit into a business' ideal user mould. A happy user is an effective user - providing value in their user experience will in turn drive value back into a business.

<h2>Case Study</h2>
<p> 
	Let's set the scene for a very simple case study - first we need to set the scene. 

	Business want: The business wants to reduce any productivity hits that may happen over the course of a day, as their developers are too valuable.

	User need: I am a developer and occasionally the internet connection where I am drops, leaving me without access to resources that assist me with development.

	The temptation here is to think "ah, so the requirement is for steady internet connection". However! That is only likely what a user will want, but what they need are the resources themselves!

	Perhaps we could explore this further and understand what types of resources a developer might need, performing a Hierarchical Task Analysis.

<h2>UX Toolbox</h2>
<p> 
	A variety of techniques were used in the case study to address the issue, so here are a few takeaways to make it clear and easy for anyone to use:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>User Scenarios:</b> This is when you simply describe a use case scenario and walk the journey of a user through what they'd be expected to do. e.g. Billy opened up his phone and used it to check notes he wrote on his computer earlier in the day.</li>
	<li><b>Micro Scenarios:</b> This builds upon User Scenarios and places it into an Agile context; people working on a project are each given a persona such as a young teenager, elderly person with poor eyesight, administrator of a system or a regular computer user who dabbles with programming.</li>
	<li><b>Hierarchical Task Analysis:</b> Takes some time to produce, but provides a clear document that shows the understand of how a task is performed step by step.</li>
</ul>
