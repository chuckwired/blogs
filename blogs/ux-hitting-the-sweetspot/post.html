	People have many different ideas about UX (and UI), what someone in this position should be doing and how best to accomplish their tasks. One abstracted notion I've learnt recently is hitting that 'sweet spot' between the business wants and the user's needs. It's a process that already occurs to some extent shared between developers, stakeholders and project managers but is perhaps the #1 goal of any UX fanatic. In this blog we'll explore this idea, present a simple case study and finish with a few tools anyone can use in their day-to-day during modern Software Development to keep the sweetness flowing.

<h2>Differing Goals</h2>
<p> 
	Before we can hit the sweet spot we need to understand both sides; there's the business wants and the user needs. Business wants are generally driven from a high level with the aim to increase value for their business. Not neccesarily monetary but can involve efficiency, enriching their product or growth of the customer base. A business doesn't need these, but they want these. From both a developer and project manager perspective this will be discovered through inceptions and the day-to-day development of a project as it grows. Requirements may change, but overall the main focus of a successful project should remain the same.

	User needs are called so because in order to satisfy the wants of a business, we have to address what the user will need in order to happily succeed. For example, a business want may be for a user to be able to process 50 orders per hour. To do that we need to understand the user's workflow, common pitfalls and restrictions so that we can best help design a system that facilitates that goal. Humans are capable of complex thought, and unfortunately irrational patterns, but we cannot force them to change. A happy user is an effective user - providing value in their user experience will in turn drive value back into a business.

<h2>Case Study</h2>
<p> 
	Let's set the scene for a simple case study - the business have an ordering system that their staff need to use to process orders, so that they can be fulfilled for customers. Currently the per-person thorughput is 40 orders per hour and the target is now 50. Staff, i.e. the users of the system, are at maximum capacity already since 

	 If I need to load orders on a per-order basis to process them then that will take significantly more time, than being able to view a list of orders and process them in the same interface.

<h2>UX Toolbox</h2>
<p> 
	A variety of techniques were used in the case study to address the issue, so here are a few takeaways to make it clear and easy for anyone to use:
