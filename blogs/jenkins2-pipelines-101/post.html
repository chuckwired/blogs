<p>
The release of Jenkins2 put a huge emphasis on <a href="https://jenkins.io/2.0/#pipelines" target="_blank">pipelines</a> - a feature that Jenkins always had but wasn't the key highlight. This all changes with the default built in pipelines that help you write your pipelines in Groovy as code, check it into SCM and visualise your pipelines from a single pipeline job type. It provides huge improvements over the "workflow" view that used to exist, but the documentation doesn't come with a rich set of example.

<p>
In this post I'm going to show you the key building blocks using Groovy, complete with code snippets and hopefully guide you on your way to true DevOps style pipelines - your pipeline as code.

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>
<p>
Before we begin we need to make sure you have the following in terms of configuration and knowledge of your Jenkins installation:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Jenkins2</b>: hopefully an obvious one, make sure you're using version 2 and above.</li>
	<li><b>Stage view plugin</b>: ensure that your installation has <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Stage+View+Plugin" target="_blank">this plugin installed.</a></li>
	<li><b>Jenkins jobs</b>: you should have built or edited a couple of Jenkins jobs that take parameters, and your installation should have at least one. If not, you won't need this blog yet.</li>
	<li><b>Can do attitude</b>: not essential but certainly helps!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic constructs</h2>
<p>
Here are a few basic constructs that will help you dearly on your way to pipeline nirvana - if you've used a programming language or two before, especially Java or Javascript, then these will feel very at home. Groovy seems to not be very forgiving in terms of newlines so pay attention to those!
</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: Use the script sandbox on your Jenkins at <code>http://your.jenkins.net:8080/script</code></p>

<h3>Node builder</h3>
<p>To build anything to need to begin by specifying it to build on a node. Most of your code will live within one of these blocks.</p>

<pre><code class='groovy'>
node('optional tag of your slave'){
    stage "Stage 1: Echo stuff"
    echo "step one in my stage!"
    echo "now I'm doing step two of my stage"
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Build a job</h3>
<p>Probably one of the first things you'll want to do, build a job you've already specified on your Jenkins installation.</p>

<pre><code class='groovy'>
build job:'some-other-job', parameters: [
    string(name: 'parameter 1', value: "value1"),
    booleanParam(name: 'DO_SOMETHING', value: true),
    string(name: 'my choice parameter', value: some_function())
]
</code></pre>

<h3>Functions and variables</h3>
<p>Now we're getting to some real pipelines as code; functions and variables are defined very similarly:</p>

<pre><code class='groovy'>
// Returns nothing
def my_first_function(param1){
    echo "I received this: " + param1
}

// Concat or add params and return them
def my_second_function(param1, param2){
    return param1 + param2
}

//Make a stage that echo's something
stage "My sandbox stage"
my_first_function("echo this, mum!")

def my_string_var = my_second_function("look at", " me")
def my_int_var = my_second_function(2, 2)
</code></pre>

<p><b>Tip</b>: You can define functions outside of your <code>node</code> block, but I've had some difficulty defining variables outside. If you've had better luck, please please <i>please</i> drop me a comment!</p>

<h3>if/else</h3>
<p>Now we're getting some flow control.</p>

<pre><code class='groovy'>
if (some_condition == true){
    echo "it was true!"
} else { // This HAS to be on the same line!
    echo "it wasn't true :disappointed:"
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Advanced constructs</h2>
<p>
Once you're comfortable with the above you'll want to explore some more options to make your pipelines more robust and give some more sophisticated flow control options.
</p>

<h3>if/else</h3>
<p>Now we're getting some flow control.</p>

<pre><code class='groovy'>
if (some_condition == true){
    echo "it was true!"
} else { // This HAS to be on the same line!
    echo "it wasn't true :disappointed:"
}
</code></pre>

<h3>if/else</h3>
<p>Now we're getting some flow control.</p>

<pre><code class='groovy'>
if (some_condition == true){
    echo "it was true!"
} else { // This HAS to be on the same line!
    echo "it wasn't true :disappointed:"
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Useful links and tools</h2>
<p>
body
</p>
<pre><code class='swift'>
	func printStuff(s: String) = {
		println("Hello world!");
	}
</code></pre>
