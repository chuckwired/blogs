	Over half a century ago software development used to follow the Waterfall methodology, a process that anyone who took a GCSE in ICT should be familiar with. Whilst it is a good basis to begin learning from we know that this model of step by step from beginning to end does not work, especially in today's mix of rapidly evolving technologies. This post explores why sometimes the UX (User Experience) process is still inserted into the development process in a Waterfall style, and convince you that a modern development methodology such as Agile can be adapted to accommodate the value that UX can bring to the table.

<h2>Why Waterfall Doesn't Work</h2>
<p> 
	As a brief reminder the Waterfall works in a linear, sequential fashion encouraging that each stage be fully complete before the next is begun. For example, time will be spent gathering all the requirements from all the stakeholders of the project and summarised before any analysis or development begins. Often it will look like in the diagram below.
</p>

<p>
	At first this appears reasonable but anyone who has ever been on a software project can attest that often work carried out further down the line uncovers missing requirements, unfavourable implementation and ultimately leads to an unhappy client. Often what the client said they wanted can't be captured in a single session, will change as time goes on and we've learnt from that. Furthermore, the cost of changing a feature increases almost exponentially the further into the process you go. Changing a requirement takes 2 minutes and may cost Â£50, whereas an almost finished product requires developmental manpower and can cost hundreds of times more for the client.

<h2>Alternative Development Methodologies</h2>
<p> 
	As you go through the academic literature and view the landscape of software development today you can see it has evolved quite rapidly. Some key examples of evolved methodologies include Spiral, Iterative, User Centered Design and Agile Development, a flavour of which we use here at Cake Solutions. I won't go into details of their styles here (they can be read by clicking on their respective links to get a better understanding) but what they have in common is this iterative feedback loop where we start with some requirements, analyse them, develop them and present them back to the client for immediate feedback before continuing on another cycle. It allows you to mould the product at a highly reduced cost compared to the traditional workflow.
</p>

<p>
	The major benefit of using this style is that clients only pay for what they immediately get, the product evolves as the client better understands what they want and can see what is possible and workload can be better prioritised to suit deadlines and budgets. On the technical side it allows us to explore techniques and methods that are tailored to the problem domain, rather than relying on a development methodology that historically has worked but may not work anymore and may not allow a tailored solution to be created.
</p>

<h2>Emergence of DevOps and UX</h2>
<p> 
	Reading around a few blogs on the internet you can see where the roots of both DevOps and UX came from - the inability of larger corporations to bring operations, development and user experience together to run in tadem, instead favouring a justified development schedule. The root of DevOps is to create a repeatable and testable framework that integrates into a well architectured solution to manage and deploy the product i.e. delivering the value. UX in a similar vein is rooted to really tailor the design of the solution to best fit the way that the users carry out their work i.e. making the value accessible. Development as you may have guessed is creating the value - but we need to see it, access it and deliver it to users and clients alike.
</p>

<p>
	All too often the work of DevOps and UX in some organisations are treated as one of processes that happen at the beginning, the middle or the end and are only there to augment the development process of software products. This should not be the case, as leaving them to the last minute make creating delivery and accessible solutions become more difficult and often hurt their names. Instead these two veins of work should be embraced and brought into the development cycle and work closely with the development team to produce a truly complete solution - a solution that is valuable, is accessible and is deliverable.
</p>

<h2>A UX example</h2>
<p>
	Let's look at how UX can be implemented in an Agile sprint, taking a mobile application I worked on previously as an example: the iOS application had several sections and could be organised in either a tabbed fashion or a side 'burger' menu fashion. We could have discussed this many times over or I could have developed one solution to show to the client, but that either lacked evidence or took more time and effort since if the decision was wrong we would have to re-implement it. Instead I simply created an interactive mock-up using both menu types in less than 2 hours using Google Slides and could show the client the differences that very same day.
</p>
<p>
	For a very small amount of effort I could mock up the solution, the client could interact with it and make an experience, evidenced based decision on which solution they prefered for their users. Some readers may argue that it would almost as easily be mocked directly in Xcode using the available storyboards, but this is just one example. What if the solution were more complex in nature? With a lot of information, interactions and screens happening at the same time? To create a mock-up saved resources, time and could bring us to a decision much faster. Ultimately this would be cheaper for any client. This is just one technique of hundreds that a UX specialist will have in their arsenal, all geared towards designing a solution that the target market can use effectively.
</p>
<p>
	In this example, the mistakes I often see and hear are when mock-ups are created at the start of the project and are taken as truth from begininng to end. Perhaps one or two iterations are made several months apart but that is completely the wrong approach to take, almost performed in a linear fashion akin to the Waterfall method. By the time the next mock-up is created the development team have already been working closely with the client and created a solution that better meets their needs and expectations, but is developed without the informed expertise of an interaction specialist. 
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
	In this blog post the Waterfall method was briefly described and how we understand that today a much different approach is needed that is iterative in nature. DevOps and UX was touched upon in the sense that they came about as a solution to better software solutions that weren't just valuable, but that the value is accessible and deliverable as well. Finally a short case study highlighted the benefit of fitting just one UX technique into the development cycle and how to wrongly incorporate UX into your development strategy.
