<p>If you're like me you often want to create your applications to handle a variety of different configurations or situations. Let's face it, it feels good to watch something you created handle whatever gets thrown at it. And that's exactly what we're going to do here.
</p>
<p>Most of the examples floating about the internet for push notifications are in Objective-C and even if they're in Swift, they only cover iOS 7 or 8 but not handling both if you'd like to support it. This blog post will give you a simple step by step showing how to identify between iOS7 and iOS8 and register for push notifications accordingly.
</p>

<h2>Step 1: Getting Started</h2>
<p>First we assume you already have an application you're working on or have completed (perhaps for some time) written in Swift. Go ahead and open up the 'AppDelegate.swift' file and checkout the first function:
    
</p>
<pre><code class='swift'>func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -&gt; Bool {
// Override point for customization after application launch.
return true
</code></pre>
<p>This is the point at which you need to handle iOS 7 or 8. To keep this simple, let's see how to solve this with pseudo code:
</p>
<pre><code>if(iOS version is 7 or below){
//register for remote notifications using iOS 7 calls
} else {
//register using iOS 8 calls
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Step 2: Distinguishing the OS version</h2>
<p>When I was trying to figure out how to make this distinction it wasn't so obvious until I actually found the solution. Why not simply just ask the system what iOS version it's running? Let's try this on my iPhone 5 running 7.1.1.
</p>
<pre><code class='swift'>UIDevice.currentDevice().systemVersion //Returns 7.1.1</code></pre>
<p>Okay... but how do I use an <code>UIDevice</code> object?</p>
<p>Ah! Of course, check it as a String and grab the first element somehow. Perhaps we could put the String into an Array...</p>
<pre><code class='swift'>String(Array(UIDevice.currentDevice().systemVersion)[0]) //Returns 7
</code></pre>

<p>Excellent; I could just compare it to another string i.e. <code class='swift'>"iOSversion == "7"</code>" but that's a little messy. Let's just call <code>toInt()</code>on it and put it within a utility method. This way we can compare it more easily later on.</p>

<pre><code class='swift'>
func getMajorSystemVersion() -> Int {
    return String(Array(UIDevice.currentDevice.systemVersion)[0]).toInt()!
}
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Step 3: Registering for Push</h2>
Perfect. Now, how do I register for push notifications? Well, we'll need to register the device for remote notifications.
<pre><code class='swift'>
//In iOS 7
UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotificationTypes(
    UIRemoteNotificationType.Badge | 
    UIRemoteNotificationType.Sound | 
    UIRemoteNotificationType.Alert)
</code></pre>

<p>Nice and simple. iOS 8 is a little more tricky though, since you need to create the settings, register for those specific settings and then register for remote notifications.</p>

<pre><code class='swift'>
//In iOS 8
let pushSettings: UIRemoteNotificationSettings = 
UIRemote NotificationSettings(forTypes: 
    UIUserNotificationType.Alert | 
    UIUserNotificationType.Badge | 
    UIUserNotificationType.Sound,
    categories: nil)
    
UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotificationSettings(pushSettings)
UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerForRemoteNotifications()
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that you don't have to register for all of the different settings, although they let you do what it says on the tin i.e. receive alerts, with a badge or with a sound too.</p>

<p>Now put it altogether and you have a nice little if statement that'll catch which OS version the device is running. To kick it up one more step (to future proof the code a little better) we could use a pattern match:</p>

<pre><code class='swift'>
switch(getMajorSystemVersion()) {
    case 7: //iOS 7 registration code
    case 8: //iOS 8 registration code
    //case 9: //iOS 9 registration code when the time comes
    default: return //do nothing as we cannot tell!
}
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Step 4: Push Delegates</h2>
Ah, sweet simplicity. Now all we need to do is implement the delegates:
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken</li>
<li dir="ltr">didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class='swift'> 
func application(application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: NSData) {
//Process the deviceToken and send it to your server
}

func application(application: UIApplication, didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError error: NSError) {

NSLog("Failed to get token; error: %@", error) //Log an error for debugging purposes, user doesn't need to know
}
</code></pre>

One thing you may not realise at first is that the deviceToken object, when converted to a <code>String</code>, looks something like this:
<code>&lt;XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX&gt;</code>
To register that token on your server and send out notifications you may want to clean it up first before saving, sending etc. I performed a simple regex and replace:

<pre><code class='swift'>
let trimEnds = deviceToken.description.stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(NSCharacterSet(charactersInString: "<>"))
let cleanToken = trimEnds.stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString(" ", withString: "", options: nil)
</pre>

And you're set! Since the device token can change e.g. when restoring a backup to a different device, it is important to register with your server back-end in the app delegate regularly. The above should suffice.</p>

<p><br><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>
<p>In this post we discovered how to identify which major version of iOS a device is running, and handle different remote registration logic accordingly using <code>Swift</code>. We did so using a robust method that would gracefully handle itself if no version was found, and logged any failures that may happen at runtime.
